# To-do-List
A simple web-based to-do list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This app helps you manage your tasks by allowing you to add, complete, delete, and filter tasks.

## Features
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete individual tasks
- Clear all completed tasks
- Filter tasks by All, Active, or Completed
- Tasks are saved in the browser (localStorage) so they persist across sessions
